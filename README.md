<h1>About</h1>
<p>This project is a clone Trello App was made back in April 2020 for a certain subject in my Second-year University Student as my Final Semester project.</p>
<p>This project is not perfect (and will never be) and not great, either. This project was made because I want to learn Python and learn how to use Tkinter to create a GUI application.</p>
<p>For anyone who want to test this project: This is my early School project so this not a 1:1 Trello Clone so it will has some limitations (For example: You can't move a card from column to column)</p>
<p>If you read to this part. Thank you for visiting my repository, I appreciated a lot :) (And appologize for my bad English, I'm still learning it :"> )</p>
